<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/relato.public/Atlanta_Security_Cluster.png" width="600px"/><p align="justify">Back in 2010 - with help from the startup community in Atlanta - I created a social network representation of the security startup cluster in Atlanta. Nowadays I&rsquo;m <a href="http://www.relato.io/">working on</a> networks in the economy full time, so this map has been on my mind.</p>
    
    <p align="justify">The map shows the degree to which apprenticeship is essential to the growth of markets. The best way to be a successful founder is to work for a hot startup, make your seed money from stock options, and start you own company with coworkers as founders. Then hire more former coworkers.</p>
    
    <p align="justify">And I wonder&hellip; what has happened between 2010 and 2015? Has the network grown? Is the network effect still happening?</p>
