<p><a href="http://www.wordnik.com/words/launch">launch</a></p>
<span><ol class="def-list"><span>–verb-transitive</span><br/><span><ol class="def-list"><li>To set going; initiate: <em>launch a career; launch a business venture.</em></li>
<li>To introduce to the public or to a market: <em>launched the new perfume with prime-time commercials on the major networks.</em></li>
</ol></span>–verb-intransitive
<li>To begin a new venture or phase; embark: <em>launch forth on a dangerous mission; launched out on her own after college.</em></li>
</ol></span></blockquote>
<p>Which leads us to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>launchism</strong></p>
<p><span>    -noun<strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span></p>
<ol><li><span><span>(product development) A product developmental disorder characterized by a focus on creating the perception of success through media manipulation rather than on creating real value for paying customers: <em>Startup X died of launchism after getting techcrunch'ed to create hype to get acquired.  Customers never showed up, now the founders work at Denny&rsquo;s.</em></span></span></li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>A wedding ain&rsquo;t a marriage.  A launch ain&rsquo;t a product.  There exists an inverse relationship between launch budget and product success, just as there is an inverse relationship between wedding budget and marital happiness.  Its about focus.  Are you focused on creating a perception of success or on creating a repeatable business model?</p>
