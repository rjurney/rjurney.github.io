<p>This month I&rsquo;m introducing myself to Japanese tea - which is nearly always green. I&rsquo;ve been introduced to other kinds of tea with expensive grades, and it has me wondering if I really know what to appreciate about &lsquo;fine&rsquo; tea.</p>

<p>So this time, with Japanese green tea, I&rsquo;m learning from the bottom up. I&rsquo;ve ordered three 'crude&rsquo; or cheap teas from <a href="http://yunomi.us">Yunomi.us</a>: <a href="https://yunomi.us/shop/7361/morita-04-sayama-karigane-premium-stem-tea-id-7361/">Kukicha</a>, <a href="https://yunomi.us/shop/6016/takeo-tea-farm-spring-konacha-ichiban-50g-id-6016/">Konacha</a> and <a href="https://yunomi.us/shop/8053/morita-03-aracha-hoju-%E5%AE%9D%E7%8F%A0-id-8053/">Aracha</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukicha"><b>Kukicha</b></a> or twig tea, also known as bōcha (棒茶), is a Japanese blend made of stems, stalks, and twigs. </p>

<p>Kukicha has a nutty, slightly grassy, intensely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami">umami</a> flavor like no other tea I&rsquo;ve had. It is said to have less caffeine than other teas, although this varies significantly.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about green tea, but when I read descriptions like &ldquo;&hellip;being composed of parts of the tea plant that are excluded from most other teas,&rdquo; I start rooting for the underdog. </p>

<p>Kukicha is my favorite green tea so far.</p>

Called &ldquo;farmers tea,&rdquo; aracha isn&rsquo;t commonly available in stores. It has a wild, complex taste. I only bought 10 grams of Aracha - enough for about 3 cups, the way I brew it. </p>

<p>Aracha is salty. It has a complex taste with a salty ending. It is far gentler than Konacha, but the aftertaste reminds me of it. This Aracha is very interesting, seems to have two natures - the up front taste and the tail. I&rsquo;m definitely going to buy some more and learn more about it.</p>

You&rsquo;ve probably had Konacha before, as it is served in sushi restaurants to erase the aftertaste of raw fish. </p>

<p>Konacha has a thick texture with lots of particles in the bottom of the cup. Its taste is complex, even overpowering, with a taste similar to kelp. It becomes bitter fast when over-brewed, so don&rsquo;t do that. </p>

<p>Konacha definitely goes well with food. It clears the palette with every sip. It is cheap, too. Fifty grams was <a href="https://yunomi.us/shop/6016/takeo-tea-farm-spring-konacha-ichiban-50g-id-6016/">$4.51 from Yunomi.us</a>.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Konacha is a tea I&rsquo;m likely to drink often. </p>

<p>All in all I enjoyed these three teas, and I&rsquo;m likely to try them again.</p>
