<blockquote>“Whenever data sparsity is an issue, smoothing can help performance,and data sparsity is almost always an issue in statistical modeling. <strong>In the </strong><strong>extreme case where there is so much training data that all parameters</strong><strong>can be accurately trained without smoothing, one can almost always </strong><strong>expand the model, such as by moving to a higher n-gram model, to </strong><strong>achieve improved performance.</strong> With more parameters data sparsity becomes an issue again, but with proper smoothing the models areusually more accurate than the original models. Thus, no matter how much data one has, smoothing can almost always help performace, and for a relatively small eﬀort.”<br/>Chen &amp; Goodman (1998)</blockquote>
