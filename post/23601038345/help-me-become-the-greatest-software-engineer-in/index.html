<p>Many of you have read my code, and you are aware that it can best be described as, &lsquo;eventually good.&rsquo; It is with great honor then that I announce my bid to be one of the greatest software engineers in the world. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-of-the-best-software-engineers-alive#answers">http://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-of-the-best-software-engineers-alive#answers</a></p>

<p>Scroll down, vote up. </p>

<p>I had a shit year, but things are looking up. I got a brand new pacemaker and bionic powers, and so I encourage you to help promote this truthiness. In return your support, you will all receive boons in the coming successes I am sure to enjoy. Perhaps a case study in my book. In addition, by upvoting me, you will be earning a Jurney number of 1, that Erdos shit having gotten stale.</p>

<p>Thanks for your support, </p>

<p>The Greatest Software Engineer in the World and Medtronic Bionic Man, <br/>
