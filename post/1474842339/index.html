<p>Wherever the image came from of a productive hacker being a vitamin D deficient couch potato, fueled entirely by Ramen and Jolt, it needs to die.</p>
<p>I slept until I wasn&rsquo;t tired and hacked until I couldn&rsquo;t focus.</p>
<p>Then I surfed south Linda Mar above.  There were soft, crumbly overhead sets, and I didn&rsquo;t get one ride.  But I got lots of paddling in before stumbling to shore through rocks and kelp.</p>
<p>Now my mind is clear. I&rsquo;m riding an endorphin high. I&rsquo;ve got many more hours of hacking in me.  </p>
<p>Human beings were not made to sit in chairs for twelve hours at a stretch pushing buttons while staring at LCDs.  Get up, go <strong>outside</strong>, move around, and come back.  You&rsquo;ll get more done.  As George Clinton said, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Your_Mind..._and_Your_Ass_Will_Follow">&lsquo;Free your ass, and your mind will follow.&rsquo;</a></p>
<p>Note: <em>The gym does not count</em>.  You are made to exercise under the sun surrounded by nature, not fluorescent lights and clinking dumbbells.  <strong>Go outside.</strong></p>
