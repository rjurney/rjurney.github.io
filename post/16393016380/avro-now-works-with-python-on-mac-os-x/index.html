<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/joecrobak">Joe Crobak</a> for the tip, I have patched the Python library for Avro to build under Mac OS X by removing its python-snappy dependency.  This has been bugging a lot of people, and while the patch removes snappy compression&hellip; I have no idea what that is, and I don&rsquo;t need it :)</p>

<p>The patch is available here: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-981">AVRO-981</a>.</p>

<p>To build Avro, you&rsquo;ll need to clone trunk from <a href="https://github.com/apache/avro.git">https://github.com/apache/avro.git</a>, apply the patch and then build and install the python library.</p>

<p>Update: it seems the problem was that Snappy is a dependency.  Install it from here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/snappy/">http://code.google.com/p/snappy/</a> and python-snappy and python avro should work :)</p>
