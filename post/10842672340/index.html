<p><span>Greek <em>technologia</em> systematic treatment of an art, from <em>technē</em> art, skill + <em>-o-</em> + <em>-logia</em> -logy</span></p>
First Known Use: 1859</blockquote>
<p>Engineers are technologists.  They hold an implicit belief that the development and application of new technology to alter the world around them is a good thing.  A thing worth doing for its own sake.  'I built that,&rsquo; is a very satisfying statement, just as &lsquo;I hunted that&rsquo; was before it.</p>
<p>Not everyone believes this.  Many people don&rsquo;t want you inventing new things, they want to go back to a simpler time - the ideal one they experienced during their childhood and early adolescence.</p>
<p>The engineering culture is defined by cliques.  In the absence of social queues on the internet and owing to the lack of empathy of the engineering population, 'brand loyalty&rsquo; to different languages, tools and techniques can lead to bitter conflict inside companies and within and between communities.  If you&rsquo;ve ever fought for the use of new technology inside a company, you know what I mean.</p>
<p>This makes for a <a href="http://localhost:4567/graph/5">great joke</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>C</strong> would be <span>Judaism</span></p>
<p><span><span>Java</span> would be <span>Fundamentalist Christianity</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>C++</span> would be <span>Islam</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>C#</span> would be <span>Mormonism</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span><span><span>Lisp</span> would be <span>Zen Buddhism</span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><strong>Perl</strong> would be <strong>Voodoo</strong></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong>Ruby </strong>would be <strong>Neo-Paganism</strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t a joke.  Technology as religion is real, as are contentions between devotees, and this isn&rsquo;t new.  It started in the 6th century BC with Pythagoras and his worshippers, the Pythagoreans.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>The early evidence suggests, however, that Pythagoras presented a cosmos that was structured according to moral principles and significant numerical relationships</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pythagorus would eventually be credited with the Pythagorean theorem, and everything else his cult came up with in the next few hundred years.  They had this habit&hellip; kind of like IRC, of throwing heretics off of cliffs.</p>
<p>I wonder if we realize how much we deify as technologists.  Mike Driscoll touched on this in his <a target="_blank" href="http://medriscoll.com/post/9117396231/the-guild-of-silicon-valley">post</a> about fat guys knowing C++.  Mike gets it, as the talent of his team attests.</p>
<p>I wonder how often we are aware of the cults at work as we navigate organizations with overlapping networks of belief.  If you cultivate and yield influence, change minds and shape opinions, are you more prophet than leader?</p>
<p>I think you are.</p>
