<p>Submitting text files via a form to update an Apache software project is the modern-day technology equivalent of medieval doctors bleeding patients while administering laxatives to cure Cholera.  </p>

<p>And yet that is the process of updating the open-source infrastructure driving the data revolution.  Compared to the simplicity of github pull requests, using a JIRA web form to submit text patches against a monolithic subversion database is extremely difficult.  Not 10x difficult.  Closer to 100x difficult for new, would-be contributors.  </p>

<p>The result is that a very high bar is set for contributors.  Which is anti-community.  And since open source relies on community&hellip; it is anti-open source.</p>

<p>We live in a post-github world.  Git enabled social coding, and it is past time that Apache caught up.</p>
