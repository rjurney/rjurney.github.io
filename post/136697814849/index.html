<p align="justify"><b>I&rsquo;ve recently discovered an amazing new treatment for chronic pain called Cannabidiol</b>, also known as CBD, that I want to tell you about.</p>

<p align="justify"><blockqoute><p><i>Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of at least 85 active cannabinoids identified in cannabis.[4] It is a major phytocannabinoid, accounting for up to 40% of the plant&rsquo;s extract.[5] CBD is considered to have a wider scope of potential medical applications than tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).</i></p>

<p align="justify">It is strange to talk openly about medical marijuana/cannabis, even as a California resident, as there is a stigma associated with it. <i>After all, lets face it&hellip; most people with &lsquo;anxiety&rsquo; that consume medical cannabis just like to get high, and medical cannabis is simply a loophole for their recreational use or even dependence.</i></p>

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rjurneyopen/CBD_Molecule.JPG" width="400px" align="right"/><p align="justify">That is why I want to talk openly about taking CBD. For a growing number of pain patients (and others), medical cannabis in the form of CBD represent an important new treatment that simply does not 'get you high,&rsquo; and yet relieves pain as effectively as any other treatment. I suffer from neck pain that is a nuisance, and CBD is a powerful new tool in my treatment of this pain.</p>

<p align="justify">To get concrete: for $60 at a local dispensary, I bought a hemp CBD 'vape pen&rsquo; that comes with a cartridge with 250mg of CBD dissolved in essential oils of hemp. Hemp being the legal form of cannabis without THC in it, used to make rope. The pen is standardized at 1mg of cannabinoids per hit. A 'hit&rsquo; is a pull or inhalation on the pen, which vaporizes (as opposed to burns) the oil and delivers it to your lungs. A working dose is several 'hits&rsquo; or inhalations.</p>

<p>The effect? <b>All pain, even severe pain, melts away in 30 seconds.</b> This effect lasts about 15 minutes. There is nothing else like this available medically. No other treatment available so quickly addresses severe pain. Vaped CBD is simply amazing. I can&rsquo;t oversell how effective it is.</p>

<p>But 15 minutes? If this were your only method of pain control, you would be vaping all day long. This is undesirable. For longer term pain control, turn to CBD sublingual drops. 10-20mg of CBD under the tongue (4-8 sprays of the drops I use) takes effect within 10 minutes and lasts for hours. A large-sized vial of drops goes for about $60 and has 90 sprays. The price of CBD has gotten much cheaper in the last couple of years and is likely to continue to decrease.</p>

<p>Used together, drops and the pen can lead to a dramatic reduction in the use of other pain medications, which means far fewer unwanted side effects. Simply put: <b>if you&rsquo;re in pain and you&rsquo;re in a state where CBD is legal, you should try CBD</b>. It is a powerful new tool to combat chronic pain.</p>
