<p>In August, 2007 <a href="http://blog.weatherby.net/2007/08/free-iphone-arr.html#comment-164860470">commented</a> on a post on <a href="http://blog.weatherby.net">Lance Weatherby&rsquo;s Blog</a>.</p>

<p>I spoke thus:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><i><bq>The iPhone is a toy and a cell phone compared to what it will become: The next dominant computing platform. Finally someone capable of wrapping advances in GPS location, bluetooth personal area networks, wireless communications, artificial intelligence, digital speech/voice recognition and web services has released a computing platform to take advantage of them all.<br/><br/>

You are walking down a city street. You have your iPhone 2.0 in your pocket, and a tiny Apple bluetooth headset on. You want coffee and wifi. Your personal digital assistant&rsquo;s name is Cleo. &ldquo;Cleo, find me coffee with wifi access.&rdquo; Cleo queries Google Maps for you and then tells you, in your bluetooth headset, the names of 5 of the nearest coffee shops with wifi, starting with the nearest. You pick the first one. &ldquo;Cleo, directions to Javaology.&rdquo; Cleo gives you directions, and tells you when you take a wrong turn.<br/><br/>

On the way, you find you love the neighborhood you are in. &ldquo;Cleo, find me an apartment in this area.&rdquo; Cleo does. She starts rattling off listings. Pick one and she&rsquo;ll give you directions.<br/><br/>

You glance in a store window and see a new book called &lsquo;Gary Potter Volume 11,&rsquo; and you have 1-10. &ldquo;Cleo, order Kama Sutra Volume 11 from Amazon to my home.&rdquo;
Feeling scared? &ldquo;Cleo, what is the crime rate in this area?&rdquo; Cleo tells you.
Cleo will announce the names of other people you meet and will exchange cards between your iPhones.<br/><br/>

We&rsquo;ll all start doing things like this in the next few years. The step after that will be glasses which will coordinate with GPS and cell location to overlay 3D imagery on the street, in malls, etc. A la Spook Country, a highly recommended read.
I know that we&rsquo;ll be doing this, because if nobody else does&hellip; I&rsquo;ll start a company to build this. But I suspect apple will do it for us.</bq></i><br/></p>

And, before there was a dev kit:<br/><br/><p style="margin-left: 30px;"><i><bq>Heh, fortunately there is a complete dev toolkit for the iPhone and it would require some platform integration.</bq></i></p>
