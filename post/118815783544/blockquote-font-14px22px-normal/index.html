	<h1>The Networked Economy</h1>

	<p>In this post we&rsquo;ll survey some adventures in networks, starting with startup ecosystems and ending in network-driven marketing.</p>

	<h2>Networks of Success</h2>

    <p>Above is a map of the security sector of the startup ecosystem in Atlanta as of 2010. Each node (circle) is a company. Each link between nodes represents a founder who worked at the originating company and went on to found the destination company. If you look, Internet Security Systems (ISS) and SecureIT (which sold the Internet Scanner by ISS) spawned most of the other companies in the cluster.</p>
    
    <p>This simple chart illustrates the network-centric process underlying the emergence of startup ecosystems. Groups of companies emerge together via &lsquo;Networks of Success,&rsquo; groups of individuals who work together and develop an abundance of skills, social capital and cash.</p>
    
    <p>This network is similar to others that are better known, like the Fairchildren or the PayPal Mafia:</p>

    <p>This was my first social network research, a domain typically limited to social scientists and PhD candidates. When I say <i>social network</i>, I don&rsquo;t mean Facebook, I mean <i>social network</i> as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis">Social Network Analysis</a>:</p>
    
    <blockquote>Social network analysis (SNA) is a strategy for investigating social structures through the use of network and graph theories. It characterizes networked structures in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the ties or edges (relationships or interactions) that connect them.</blockquote>
    
    <p>The Atlanta startup map shows the importance of apprenticeship in building startups and ecosystems. Participating in a solid IPO is equivalent to seed funding for every early employee. This is what is missing from startup ecosystems in provincial places… collectively, there isn’t enough success and capital for the employees of successful companies to have enough skills and capital to start their own ventures.</p>
    
    <p>Once that tipping point occurs, though, where startups beget startups, startup ecosystems self-sustain. They grow on their own. Older generations of entrepreneurs invest in and mentor younger entrepreneurs, with each cohort becoming increasingly wealthy and well connected. Atlanta has a cycle of wealth occurring in the security sector, making it a great place to start a security company.</p>
    
    <p>My hope with this map was to affect policy - to encourage the state to redirect stimulus money towards economic clusters that <b>work</b> as this one does. This remains a hope.</p>
        
    <p>In any case&hellip; thats a lot to learn from a simple map, but thats the kind of insight collecting and analyzing social networks can provide.</p>
    
    <h2>Inbox Networks</h2>

    After discovering the Enron dataset, I set my eyes on email: extracting clusters of networks of people and their relationships.
