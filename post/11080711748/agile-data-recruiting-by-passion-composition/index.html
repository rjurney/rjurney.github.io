<p><em>Note: the term Agile Data was probably coined by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/peteskomoroch">Pete Skomoroch</a>.  I remember saying it a month before him, but jumble ups happen and its probably his, GREAT word and summarizes my entire worldview.</em></p>

<p>There two ways of recruiting for data teams.</p>

<p>Candidates can come from: broad search via job listings on home page/job boards, targeted search through community participation (attending user groups and events - in person, on line), targeted ads, and internal/external referrals - with or without bounties.</p>

<ul><li>Method 1. (Classic) Hire by search and evaluation.  Evaluate basic competence to minimum requirements through method of choice (whiteboard hell, take-home exercises, arbitrary chats and first-impressions), and then evaluation of specific areas and  &lsquo;cultural fit&rsquo;.  Meet as a group, and hire the guy or don&rsquo;t.<br/><br/>Assign him to his team, and start putting folders on his desk according to tasks already setup on the project.<br/><br/></li>

<li>Method 2. (Agile Data) Only hire open-source committers.  Then, make it the job of each employee, team member, manager and recruiter to actively engage with and give back to the open-source communities whose tools you are using.  Don&rsquo;t just sell to these groups - sponsor events, pay for pizza, get speakers, push patches and liase with leaders.  Learn the needs of the group, and the passions and interests of possible candidates, and how they might intersect your project.  This requires technical expertise, so teams and recruiters must keep in touch about what is needed and what is relevant for new candidates - beyond a skills list in the requisition.<br/><br/>
It may seem like like 'pounding the pavement&rsquo; to recruit doesn&rsquo;t scale - but it does.  People that show up to events are rich in 10x engineers.<br/><br/>
Write your requisition as a success story, along with the traditional format (for SEO).  Do not say 'ninja&rsquo; or 'rockstar.&rsquo;<br/><br/><b>Hiring engineers that get to scratch a series of itches he/she already has, in your project, is how you get 10x and 100x engineers.</b>  Guys that work too much.  Regardless of qualifications.  The right guy with the right basic skills and itches to scratch will beat the crap of a traditionally trained expert in any area more often than not.  And they&rsquo;re hungrier, too.  As a team lead, you are looking for an overlap in itches that get your vision built.  &ldquo;I am really into X, and I&rsquo;d like to work with a front-end guy into Y.&rdquo;
</li> 
</ul><p><em><strong><em>Consequences</em></strong></em></p>

<p><i>Agile development ain&rsquo;t optional.</i>  You don&rsquo;t get to decide your precise product form from the top level, because you will need to alter your working specification or prototype (the best spec!) such that it scratches enough of the itches of the best candidates in your pool such that they are motivated.  The candidate with the most <i>edge</i> and the most overlapping itch that combines with other team members.</p>

<p>Using this method, you may hire more junior developers than you had planned.  Foster a culture where more senior developers help more junior ones, who aren&rsquo;t afraid of being fired while they get up to speed.</p>

<p><em><strong><em>Motivation</em></strong></em></p>

<p><b>Bored developers are the most dangerous thing an organization can have.</b>  They will increase the complexity of a project such that it scratches their itches, sliding it by product managers and the rest of the team as essential, regardless of the actual project fit for any technology/technique.  They will increase technical debt.  This isn&rsquo;t always intentional, and it is often not planned.  It just happens.  The bored mind will engage itself with inside or outside interests.  <i>If you recruit, hire and compose teams accordingly, and you&rsquo;ll have 10x teams kicking ass, instead of teams that seem to slow down after a few months as boredom sets in.</i></p>
