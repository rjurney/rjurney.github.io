<p><b>What does it feel like to be stupid?</b></p>

<p>I recently found out I had Bradycardia for a year. Oximetry indicated frequent hypoxia. My heart paused for 5, 6 then 7 seconds during one short window.Â  My brain was starved for oxygen for a year and every day I was exhausted by these &lsquo;near death&rsquo; experiences while I slept.</p>

<p>Once doctors put a pacemaker in, I noticed a profound improvement. So did my family. I am myself again. :)</p>

<p>Becoming dumb was like forgetting your lines as an actor. Lines you&rsquo;ve worked like hell to remember and then stumble over on stage, in front of a live audience. The words don&rsquo;t come.</p>

<p>Being dumb came with a shocking loss of privilege. This was humbling. Smart people, like the very attractive, get special treatment they do not know they are getting. A slower mind and the normal treatment that comes with it makes the world look cruel, unfair and cold.</p>

<p>It was a shocking blow, a loss of identity. I was the guy that came up with the answers. Not anymore.</p>

<p>It was most frustrating to be tricked, manipulated and used. I could sense what was happening but could not sidestep the tricks. I could see myself being manipulated but was helpless to defend myself as my intellect became overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Worst of all was feeling like people thought I was some kind of fraud, in that I could no longer reproduce or even accurately describe feats from the past. To be challenged in your accomplishments adds insults to injury as you struggle with your limitations.</p>

<p>There was some upside. I learned to cry freely. I can now openly weep at an emotional part of a film and feel it more than I would have before. I learned to control my temper. I learned patience. And I learned what remains if you take away all that makes me unique and special - and I learned to be okay with that person. I&rsquo;d rather be smart, but I can always find something to do, enjoy my family and spend my spare time painting.</p>

<p>I decided to focus more on writing and teaching than doing, which I found to be easier than the applied work I was doing before. Now that I can finish it, I got a book out of it.</p>
